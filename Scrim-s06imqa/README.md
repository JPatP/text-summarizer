Error Debugging: 

My pointers for solution are: 
1. Buy $5 credits
2. Make sure to create a new Anthropic api key after buying credits. Do not use old api key.
3. Use the model "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620". claude-3 and claude-7 will not work.
4. Make sure to run "npm run deploy" every time I edit the worker/src/index.js file.
