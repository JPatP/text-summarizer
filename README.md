# Claude-Powered Text Summarizer

A fast, Claude 3.5 Sonnet-powered summarization tool built on top of a frontend template provided by Scrimba.  
I focused on developing the backend logic, API integration, and deploying a working AI-powered web tool.

## Tech Stack

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Anthropic SDK
- Cloudflare Workers (Backend API)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Scrimba-provided frontend)
- CORS-enabled integration

---

## Features

- Claude-based summarization with adjustable word count
- CORS-compliant API setup using Cloudflare Workers
- Frontend integrates real-time input/output and copy-to-clipboard
- Full loading/error handling flow
- Hosted frontend and backend

## My Contribution

While the UI was provided through Scrimba's Intro to Claude AI Course, **I fully implemented the backend integration**, including:

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet API integration using Anthropic SDK
- Cloudflare Worker CORS setup
- JSON parsing and safe response handling
- API debugging, deployment, and testing


## Debugging Solutions (What Helped Me Fix Errors)

Here are the critical solutions I found that made the API work:

1. **Buy $5 credits from Anthropic**  
2. **Create a *new* API key** after buying credits â€” old keys might silently fail  
3. Use the correct model name:  
   ```text
   claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
   ```
4. Always redeploy your worker after editing:
   ```bash
   npx run deploy
   ```
